        #"The opening keynote was incredible â€” I felt genuinely inspired. However, the air conditioning in Hall B was barely working, and it got really hot and uncomfortable. A few people even walked out. The app crashed twice when I tried to view the agenda, which was frustrating. Also, the directions to the networking area were unclear and the signs were poorly placed. Despite all that, the volunteers were super helpful and the closing concert was amazing. But there was a moment during the panel when someone mentioned hearing a strange popping sound backstage â€” not sure what it was but it spooked a few of us.",
        #"The event had its moments. The opening ceremony was quite cheerful and the crowd felt very engaged, but it quickly turned chaotic. The food section ran out of water and sandwiches by noon, and I had to wait over 25 minutes in line just to find that out. The volunteers were nowhere to be seen near the help desk, and I got conflicting directions from attendees. Also, the workshop hall was super dim, and the presentation slides werenâ€™t visible from the back. I honestly started feeling kind of lost and overwhelmed. The only good part was the music set at the end â€” really lifted the vibe.",
        "Brooo the queue was wild ðŸ’€ waited like forever just to get in. No shade or water either, felt like I was in a survival game lmao. App glitched twice when I tried to check the map (big yikes), and no volunteers in sight â€” literally ghost town vibes. Then I asked someone where the main stage was and they sent me in circles. I'm not even mad anymore, just spiritually exhausted ðŸ˜©. Btw, music slapped tho ðŸŽ§ðŸ”¥"
